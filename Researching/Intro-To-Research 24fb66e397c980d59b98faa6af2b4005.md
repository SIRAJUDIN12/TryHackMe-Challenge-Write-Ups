## Note :

> research effectively is *the* most important quality for a hacker to have. By its very nature, hacking requires a *vast*
 knowledge base — because how are you supposed to break into something 
if you don't know how it works? The thing is: no one knows everything. 
Everyone (professional or amateur, experienced or totally new to the 
subject) will encounter problems which they don't automatically know how
 to solve. This is where research comes in, as, in the real world, you 
can't ever expect to simply be handed the answers to your questions.
